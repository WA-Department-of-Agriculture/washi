Inspired by other branding R packages such as [`glitr`](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI/glitr), [`ratlas`](https://github.com/atlas-aai/ratlas), and [`nmfspalette`](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/nmfspalette), `washi` provides color palettes and themes consistent with Washington Soil Health Initiative (WaSHI) branding.

## Installation

You can install the development version of washi from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("WA-Department-of-Agriculture/washi")
```
