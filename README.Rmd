Inspired by other branding R packages such as [`glitr`](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI/glitr), [`ratlas`](https://github.com/atlas-aai/ratlas), and [`nmfspalette`](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/nmfspalette), `washi` provides color palettes and themes consistent with Washington Soil Health Initiative (WaSHI) branding. This package is to be used only by direct collaborators within WaSHI, though you are welcome to adapt the package to suit your own organization's branding.

Learn what functions are available and how to use them on the [function reference webpage](https://wa-department-of-agriculture.github.io/washi/reference/index.html).

For help within RStudio, place your cursor within the function name then press `F1` to open the help page or `F4` to open the source code.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `washi` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("WA-Department-of-Agriculture/washi")
library(washi)
```

## Requirements

### Install and import fonts

`washi` uses Poppins and Lato fonts through the [{extrafont}](https://github.com/wch/extrafont) package. You can install these on your computer by running:

```{r install-fonts, eval=FALSE}
washi_install_fonts()
```

This function opens a window with the font files and provides instructions for installation. Alternatively, you can download and install the font families directly from Google:

-   Poppins: <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins>
-   Lato: <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato>

![](man/figures/README-googlefonts.png){style="outline-style: solid;     outline-width: thin; outline-color: gray;"}

Once the fonts are installed, import them into the extrafont database:

```{r import-fonts, eval=FALSE}
washi_import_fonts()
```

This function should only need to be run once. Then restart your R session (Ctrl + Shift + F10). 

### Make fonts available

Every session, you must register the fonts by attaching the {extrafont} package with `library(extrafont)`. 

To check that fonts are available, run:
```{r check-fonts}
fonts <- c("Lato", "Poppins")
all(fonts %in% extrafont::fonts())
```

If you have any issues, please see the [{extrafont} documentation](https://github.com/wch/extrafont) for detailed requirements and instructions.

## Palettes

To list the names of all available palettes, call `names(washi_pal)`. To view a palette, use the `washi_pal_view()` function.

#### All WaSHI standard colors

This palette is primarily to access individual brand colors for fonts, table headers, graphic backgrounds, etc. These colors, when used together in plots, are not accessible to those who may have color blindness.

Individual colors can be accessed with `washi_pal[["standard"]][["green"]]`.

```{r standard, fig.height = 2.5}
washi_pal_view("standard")
```

#### WaSHI colors adjusted to be more color-blind friendly

```{r color_blind, fig.height = 2.5}
washi_pal_view("color_blind")
```

#### Color gradients

Available in green, blue, red, and gold.

```{r green_gradient, fig.height = 2.5}
washi_pal_view("green_gradient", n = 4, reverse = TRUE)
```

## Data

`washi` provides an example dataset, which was subset and anonymized from the [WaSHI State of the Soils Assessment](https://agr.wa.gov/departments/land-and-water/natural-resources/soil-health/state-of-the-soils). This dataset comes in a long, tidy form with one measurement per row; and in a wide form with one sample per row. Its purpose is to provide an example soils dataset to use in plots and tables.

## Plots

`washi` provides `ggplot2` scale and theme functions that apply WaSHI colors, fonts, and styling.

### Example workflow:

```{r plot-workflow}
library(extrafont) # Package must be loaded to use WaSHI fonts
library(ggplot2)

# 1. Prepare data
example_data_long |>
  subset(measurement %in% c("totalC_%", "poxC_mg.kg") &
    !texture == "Loamy Sand") |>
  # 2. Pipe to ggplot()
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = texture, color = texture)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of POXC (mg/kg) and Total C (%)",
    subtitle = "Example with geom_density() and facet_wrap()."
  ) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ measurement, scales = "free") +
  # 3. Add washi_theme() with argument to change legend position
  washi_theme(legend_position = "bottom") +
  # 4. Add washi_scale()
  washi_scale() +
  # 5. Tweak for your specific plot
  xlab(NULL) +
  guides(col = guide_legend(nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE))
```

### Scatter plot

```{r scatter-plot}
# Single geom_point plot
example_data_wide |>
  subset(crop %in% c("Apple", "Cherry", "Potato")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = pH, y = Mn_mg.kg, color = crop)) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter plot of pH and Mn (mg/kg)",
    subtitle = "Example with geom_point().",
    caption = "This is a caption."
  ) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5) +
  washi_theme() +
  washi_scale()
```

### Barplot

```{r barplot}
example_data_wide |>
  ggplot(aes(x = forcats::fct_rev(forcats::fct_infreq(crop)))) +
  geom_bar(fill = washi_pal[["standard"]][["blue"]]) +
  geom_text(
    aes(
      y = after_stat(count),
      label = after_stat(count)
    ),
    stat = "count",
    hjust = 2.5,
    color = "white"
  ) +
  # Flip coordinates to accomodate long crop names
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of samples in each crop",
    subtitle = "Example plot with geom_bar() without gridlines.",
    y = NULL,
    x = NULL
  ) +
  # Turn gridlines off
  washi_theme(gridline_y = FALSE, gridline_x = FALSE) +
  # Remove x-axis
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

### Tables

`washi` provides a function to create a `flextable` with WaSHI colors, fonts, and styling.

```{r table}
ft <- example_data_wide |>
  head(5) |>
  subset(select = c(
    "sampleId",
    "crop",
    "totalN_%",
    "totalC_%"
  )) |>
  washi_flextable(cols_bold = 1)
```

```{r save-table, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
flextable::save_as_image(ft, path = "man/figures/README-table-1.png")
```

![](man/figures/README-table-1.png){width="458"}
