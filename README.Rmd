Inspired by other branding R packages such as [`glitr`](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI/glitr), [`ratlas`](https://github.com/atlas-aai/ratlas), and [`nmfspalette`](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/nmfspalette), `washi` provides color palettes and themes consistent with Washington Soil Health Initiative (WaSHI) branding.
